1.Created venv added interpreter / gitignore / license / readme.md
2.Created structure and added raw data.
3.Creating file connect.py to establish connection with DB.
4.Adding data_processing.py to clean the columns (had to add exceptions for "sold" category as True boolens were filtered out.
5.Set main to export csv data to postgreSQL.


Inside PostgreSQL:
Once items are in the server created new table to have only items that were sold.
CREATE TABLE fashion_resale_sold AS
SELECT *
FROM fashion_resale
WHERE sold = TRUE;

ALTER TABLE fashion_resale_sold
ADD PRIMARY KEY (product_id);


Basic insights:
Sell-through rate
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE sold = TRUE)::float / COUNT(*) AS sell_through_rate FROM fashion_resale;
0.0154% which is very low as 890992 rows while sold were 13736 items.
Why it is important? To see the size of the shop and how popular is it.

Most popular brands that were sold:
SELECT brand_name, COUNT(*) AS sold_count
FROM fashion_resale_sold
GROUP BY brand_name
ORDER BY sold_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

"Gucci"	853
"Prada"	527
"Hermès"	348
"Burberry"	338
"Chanel"	329
"Louis Vuitton"	304
"Balenciaga"	289
"Dolce & Gabbana"	288
"Christian Louboutin"	247
"Saint Laurent"	236

In total most popular brands
SELECT brand_name, COUNT(*) AS sold_count
FROM fashion_resale
GROUP BY brand_name
ORDER BY sold_count DESC
LIMIT 10;

"Gucci"	40101
"Burberry"	23932
"Dolce & Gabbana"	21732
"Prada"	20579
"Hermès"	18670
"Louis Vuitton"	18555
"Chanel"	14753
"Nike"	13595
"Valentino Garavani"	10529
"Balenciaga"	10450


Now dependancy on how many items were sold depending on quantity of items:

SELECT
    l.brand_name,
    l.listed_count,
    COALESCE(s.sold_count, 0) AS sold_count,
    ROUND(COALESCE(s.sold_count, 0)::decimal / l.listed_count * 100, 2) AS sold_percentage
FROM
    (SELECT brand_name, COUNT(*) AS listed_count
     FROM fashion_resale
     GROUP BY brand_name
     ORDER BY listed_count DESC
     LIMIT 10) l
LEFT JOIN
    (SELECT brand_name, COUNT(*) AS sold_count
     FROM fashion_resale_sold
     GROUP BY brand_name) s
ON l.brand_name = s.brand_name
ORDER BY l.listed_count DESC;


"brand_name","listed_count","sold_count","sold_percentage"
"Gucci","40101","853","2.13"
"Burberry","23932","338","1.41"
"Dolce & Gabbana","21732","288","1.33"
"Prada","20579","527","2.56"
"Hermès","18670","348","1.86"
"Louis Vuitton","18555","304","1.64"
"Chanel","14753","329","2.23"
"Nike","13595","84","0.62"
"Valentino Garavani","10529","226","2.15"
"Balenciaga","10450","289","2.77"

Why is it important? You can see dependencie if the quantity is equal to item popularity.
