1.Created venv added interpreter / gitignore / license / readme.md
2.Created structure and added raw data.
3.Creating file connect.py to establish connection with DB.
4.Adding data_processing.py to clean the columns
5.Set main to export csv data to postgreSQL.

Main goals:
Task 1: PostgreSQL – Clean & Structure the Dataset
Goal inside Pycharm: Make the dataset clean, have only necessary column and ready for queries.
Goal inside PgAdmin: From given data we will figure out sales performace, seller performence, product trends inside sql.

1. Sales performance
    - Total sales of the set
    - Total items sold in the set
    - Avg price
    - How many items sold in precentage from total items listed
    - Revenue by category
    - Revenue by season
2. Seller performance
    - Total per seller
    - Total items sold per seller
    - Avg earing per sold item
    - Top seller countries
3. Product trends
    - Best selling categories
    - Top brands
    - Color Trend
    - Material Trend
    - Gender performance
    - Dependancy on condition
    - Season performance




Task 2: Power BI – Analytics Dashboard Prep
Goal: Visualise findings. Add additional insights
Each step has to have its Why it is important and must be understood how it is done.

Task 3: Machine Learning – Feature Engineering & Modeling Prep
Goal: Build a dataset to predict price, sales success, or product desirability.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task 1: PostgreSQL Clean & Structure the dataset for it.
data_processing.py establishment

---loading data set. Parameter low_memory=False, to load big data set. ---
By default if not False data is checked by chunks which may lead to wrong interpretation of the column category

---Deciding which Columns to keep for SQL base ---

Product_type: filtered out product types that had less than 100 entries //
Prodect_category: New product types for narrow categories from product_type
Product_gender_target: two categories for woman and men.
Product_category:   6 in category, clear distinction. Missing values filled with 'Other'. First thought was dropping those rows out.
Product_season: 2 categories Autum / Winter, Spring / Summer.
Product_condition: 5 categories: Very good condition, never worn, good condition, never worn, with tag, fair condition.
Sold: essential category to see which items were sold.
Available: - if not available remove line. In dataset non missing
In_stock: - if not in stock remove.In dataset non missing
Brand_name: essential category. Unique count 8884. Brands with less than 50 entries 7480.
Product_material. 70 categories. With less than 1000 38, creating category others
Product_color: 30 unique colours
